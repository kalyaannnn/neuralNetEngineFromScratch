# Autograd Engine

This project implements an autograd engine from scratch and uses it to train a neural network on the MNIST dataset.

## Features

- Custom tensor implementation with automatic differentiation
- Support for basic tensor operations (addition, multiplication, etc.)
- Neural network layers (Linear, ReLU, etc.)
- Training and evaluation on the MNIST dataset

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy matplotlib
   ```

## Usage

1. To load the MNIST dataset and verify the loading process:
   ```bash
   python examples/test_mnist_loading.py
   ```

2. To train the neural network on the MNIST dataset:
   ```bash
   python examples/train_mnist.py
   ```
